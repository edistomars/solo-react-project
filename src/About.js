        I have several years of higher education work experience under my belt;
        mainly in a medical school environment. Within the past year, I began
        taking coding workshops where I have successfully completed projects and
        earned certifications. Since May 2021, I have received the following
        certifications:{" "}
        <em>
          Introduction to Coding, Front-End Development, Responsive Web
          Development, and React Development
        </em>{" "}
        <br />
        <br />I am looking forward to one day, in the near future, having a
        career in web development üë©‚Äçüíª.
